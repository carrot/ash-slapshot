Usage:

    slapshot:init
        Initializes the current directory with a `slapshot_config.yaml` file
        in the current directory, assuming the current directory is not
        already initialized.

        After running slapshot:init, you must edit the `slapshot_config.yaml`
        file to make sure all of the values are correct.  If you have
        initialized slapshot in the root of an Android project, it is likely
        that the only value that you will have to edit is the
        `hockey_app_api_token`.

    slapshot:upload [--silent]
        This will create a build, using the `slapshot_config.yaml` file in
        the current working directory.

        It will then upload the new build to HockeyApp.

        Adding the `--silent` flag will prevent any email notifications
        from HockeyApp to be sent out as a result of this build.
