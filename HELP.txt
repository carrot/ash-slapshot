Usage:

    slapshot:init
        Initializes the current directory with a `slapshot_config.yaml` file
        in the current directory, assuming the current directory is not
        already initialized.

        After running slapshot:init, you must edit the `slapshot_config.yaml`
        file to make sure all of the values are correct.  If you have
        initialized slapshot in the root of an Android project, it is likely
        that you will not need to edit any values.

    slapshot:upload [--silent]
        This will create a build, using the `slapshot_config.yaml` file in
        the current working directory.

        This will then upload the current debug build to HockeyApp.

        Adding the `--silent` flag will prevent any email notifications
        from HockeyApp to be sent out as a result of this build.
